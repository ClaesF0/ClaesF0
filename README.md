- ðŸ˜„ About me:
I worked in nightlife alongside studies in archaeology and engineering before finishing a degree in social work towards adolescents, and worked within specialized healthcare for a number of years before deciding to make development my forever-field.

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
Directly translated, the european placenames Provence, KÃ¶ln (Cologne) and Bayern (Bavaria) are inherited from the Romans. 
These places were in order called 'The Province', 'The Colony' and 'Land of the Barbarians'.
